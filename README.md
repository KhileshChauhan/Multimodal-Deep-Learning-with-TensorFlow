# Multimodal Deep Learning with TensorFlow
Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) enjoys a wide spectrum of applications ranging from e-commerce and security screening to complicated healthcare applications. Through this course, youâ€™ll gain access to unique material in multimodal deep learning.

Starting from simple image-based emotion recognition as a running example, you'll add more modalities, such as voice and gestures to illustrate how they improve performance of the model. You'll also understand the mathematical background of emotion recognition and implement emotion recognition pipeline in TensorFlow. As the chapters progress, you'll learn methods to run machine learning algorithms on graphs. Through various applications, such as Parkinson disease identification and taxi ride demand prediction, you'll explore generalizing convolutional networks and how they can be used.

By the end of the course, you'll have enough mathematical background and TensorFlow knowledge to implement your own multimodal deep learning applications.


## What you will learn
* Detect emotions using facial expressions, voices, and gestures
* Caption images using pictures, text, and voice as modalities
* Build and test enhanced multiresolution image style transfer model
* Use the multihop LINE algorithm to embed graph vertices in word2vec way
* Implement a simply multiview GCN to predict traffic congestion
* Refresh basic and intermediate concepts of graph theory

### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
* **Memory**: 4GB RAM (8 GB Preferred)
* **Hard disk**: 35 GB or more
* Stable Internet connection

### Software requirements
You'll also need the following software installed in advance:
* **OS**: OS: Windows 7, 8.1, or 10 64-bit, Ubuntu, or the latest version of macOS
* Browser: Google Chrome/Mozilla Firefox Latest Version
* Notepad++/Sublime Text as IDE (Optional, as you can practice everything using Jupyter notebook on your browser)
* Python 3.4+ (latest is Python 3.7) installed (from https://python.org)


**The following Python libraries are needed**:
* Numpy
* Pandas
